## Description 
> Our system will be used by people who shop online often, are fashion savvy, and eco-friendly. 
> Instead of shopping at thrift stores which have inflated prices and filthy workspaces. 
> You could use our web app to find what you're looking for with pictures, sizes, and an algorithm curated to your tastes. 
> Our system will give customers two options; to drop off or pick up from the retailer.

> What will separate this website from others? If a Retailer lives near a Customer they will have the option to share their location. 
> This will allow the Retailer and Customer to skip using a postal service, and deliver the product themselves. 
> This could also potentially enable same day deliveries, allowing Customers to get their product faster for an additional charge. 
> For this to work both the Customer and Retailer will need to consent to having their drop-off locations enabled. 

> Our website will be a second hand online clothing store. Customers, and Retailers will be able to interact. 
> Customers, and Retailers will start off with creating a profile with their username and password as well as their profile name. 
> Their profile name will be able to be different from their username if prefered. 
> On our website Customers can choose to become Retailers(Sellers) at any time. 
> The layout of the website will be in the form of a photo gallery, and you will be able to scroll through the images of the products.
