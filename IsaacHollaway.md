## About Me
I started as an English Major, but decided to switch to Computer Science. Some of the hobbies I enjoy include: Cooking, Crocheting, Gaming, Creating Mods for Games, 3D Sculpting, and creative writing. I swtiched over to Computer Science because I thought it would be the best medium for me to creatively convey stories.

## My CSC340 Goals
I have no intention of going into software engineering, my main goal is to produce a web app that I am happy with, and could use as an example of my work for a future employer.
