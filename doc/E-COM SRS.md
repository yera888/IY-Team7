## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose
The purpose of this SRS is to show both the users-view and developer-view requirements for the EdotCOM webpage. This page is an E-Commerse website that is an online second hand thift store. The requirements for the users deal with all the interactions the user can have with the website which could be interacted with as a buyer or a seller. The developer-oriented requirments specify on the developmental aspects and constraints that must be known in detail to provide the best outputs or functional features to meet the users needs. 

### 1.2 Product Scope
Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. Explain what the product that is covered by this SRS will do, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem. 
Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.

### 1.5 Document Overview
Section 1 contains a detailed introduction of the document to give readers a good general idea of what it is about. Section 2 has information on the functions/features for all the suggested roles and ways to interact with the webpage. Section 3 gives the requiements both functional and non-functional with aadded nitty-gritty information about the webpage mostly for the developer.

## 2. Product Overview
EdotCOM will be used by people who shop online often, are fashion savvy, and eco-friendly. Instead of shopping at thrift stores which have inflated prices and filthy workspaces. Customers can use EdotCOM to find local sellers, view listings and the ability to leave reviews based on their experience with other retailers. EdotCOM will also give local customers, and retailers two options: to drop off or pick up from the retailer or customer.

### 2.1 Product Functions

* Create Listing of each product with detail description of all its attributes.
* Interact with interface easily to navigate through filtered options such as by price, popularity, etc.
* Have the option to enable location so locals can either pick up or drop off products.
* A feature for the buyer and seller to communicate with one another about an individual product.
* #Tag system that you can apply to each product for neater organization and categorized sections to search through.
* #Tags only shown inside the search bar and can be clicked on from there no free word tags.
* Filtering option by popularity, price as well as a sorting option for low to high or high to low prices etc.
* Seller Rating and review System 
* Feed of listed items presented as a photo gallery
* Saving feature which would be a Like or Love albumn both in separate webpage locations.
* Recieved notifications for both the seller and buyers for things like when a product has been shipped, how many views a listiing recieved, if a buyer sent a chat message to the seller, meet up updates, refunds or cancels. 
* Stats shown to seller of their most viewed items.
* Discount UX if a product has reduced in price it shows the product is on sale.
* Create an account with username and password and requires both an email and a phone number. 
* Banning option for potential scammers which doesnt allow scammers to re-signup through email and number.

### 2.2 Product Constraints

Scamming can be a big issue on these websites.


If there are too many people on when a popular drop happens it can cause lagging


 packages being sent to the wrong location/adress, since they are one.


 Uses outside services for payments, emails, maps, and image storage.

Â 
 Free or beta plans may limit how much we can store or how many requests we can make.


 Use a fixed set of tags provided by the system, will have to keep updating with new trends.


 Hold the payment at checkout and finish it only after shipping or meet up confirmation


 Meet ups happen at public places and show a short safety note


 keeping logs of people who get banned 


  
### 2.3 User Characteristics

Our website application does not expect our users to have any abnormal computer knowledge. Our system functions were designed using other similar or widely used websites. As long as users are familiar with online shopping, creating playlists, and filling out forms they should have no issues navigating, and using the application.  

Though we do plan on catering more specifically to users that are interested in selling, and buying second hand clothing. Users that are unfamiliar with the process should be able to easily ascertain how the application functions.

### 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).
